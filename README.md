# ISS-API

## Purpose

- This is a simple backend API server for another repository, iss-spotter - located here:
  - https://github.com/davemgj84/iss-spotter
- Acts as a proxy or middleman for making API requests to the Open-Notify API, to fetch data for the next available times to see the Internation Space Station pass overhead.
